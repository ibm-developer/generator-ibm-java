This is a yeoman generator that will create Java code for you.

It is published on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-ibm-java)

## Overview
The generator works by taking the answers that the user has supplied, either via the CLI or a UI, and then maps that to a folder under the templates directory. All files are processed using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to insert the configuration specified by the user.

## Building app

### Pre-requisites

* Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) from IBM internal site (JIM)
* Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) by running ```npm install -g yo```

### Building and running the generator

1. Clone this repository and navigate to *generator-ibm-java/generator-java*
2. Run ```npm install``` in *generator-java* to install all of the node modules
3. Run ```npm link``` in *generator-java* to link the local java yeoman generator (see [here](http://yeoman.io/authoring/index.html) for more details
4. Run ```yo ibm-java``` to test the generator

## Contribution

In order to publish changes, you will need to fork the repository or ask to join the `ibm-developer` org and branch off the `master` branch.

Make sure to follow the [conventional commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) before contributing. To help you with commit a commit template is provide.
Run `config.sh` to initialize the commit template to your `.git/config` or you can use

Once you are finished with your changes, run `npm test`, `npm testint` and `npm teste2e` to make sure all tests pass.

Do a pull request against `master`, make sure the build passes. A team member will review and merge your pull request.
Once merged to `master` one pull request will be created against `master`. Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md and the package.json is correct before merging the auto generated pull request. After the autogenerated
pull request has been merged to `master` the version will be bumped and published to npm.
